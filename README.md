# basic_chess.py

This is an extremely basic Python chess game adapted from an earlier portfolio project.
This project was created as part of my learning journey in object-oriented programming and game logic using Python.

> *Note:* This game of chess ends when a King is captured. 
> Many other standard chess rules (like check, castling, and en passant) are NOT implemented.

## Features

- Full 8x8 board with proper starting positions
- All standard pieces: Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King
- Text-based board with Unicode chess pieces
- Turn-based logic (White goes first)
- Game ends when one King is captured
- User plays as both the WHITE/BLACK team by inputting alternating moves via the command line

## How to Play

Clone this repo and run the main Python file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CASCAD1AN/basic_chess_game.git
cd basic_chess_game
python3 basic_chess.py
